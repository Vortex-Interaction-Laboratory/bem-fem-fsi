"""Verification of the ventilation model, against closed forms and the paper.

    python3 verify_vent.py                 # all six cases, about 3 min
    python3 verify_vent.py --case V4       # one case: V1..V6
    python3 verify_vent.py --quick         # the cheap ones (V1, V2, V5)

Every number in docs/VENTILATION.md comes from a run of this file, and the tables
hold what was measured. Nothing is written and no figure is created.

    V1 sectional      the fits of Harwood et al. against Acosta and Tulin
    V2 exactness      the free surface, the antisymmetry, and the load path
    V3 baseline       the wetted surface-piercing strut, and its depth loading
    V4 load loss      lift, drag and the centre of pressure, against figures 12-14
    V5 washout        the boundary (4.5), its own derivation, and Breslin & Skalak
    V6 hysteresis     the bi-stable range, and the coupled response to a transition

Three things about the reading of these tables. First, V1, V2 and V5 compare
against closed forms, exact symmetries and an equation re-derived here, so their
agreement is verification. Second, V3, V4 and V6 compare against a towing-tank
experiment through a low-order model, so their TRENDS are the verified statement
and their magnitudes are reported, not verified - the wording is used explicitly
wherever it applies. Third, the stall angle, the pressure-recovery fraction, the
inception area fraction and the Weber threshold are INPUTS of this model, not
results, and every case that depends on one prints it in its header.
