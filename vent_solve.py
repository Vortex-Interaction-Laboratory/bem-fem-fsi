"""The ventilated solve: the free-surface image, the cavity, and their fixed point.

The system half of the seam to the vendored solver. Everything here is one
composition of `thick_panel_wing.assemble_system` under two masks - the image,
which flips the sign of the source strengths on the mirror half, and the cavity,
which swaps the unknown from the doublet strength to the source strength on the
cavity panels - and the fixed point that closes the cavity.

Seven dependency-ordered sections, and the same three discipline rules: nothing
imports downward, every block is a pure function over explicit arguments with all
mutable data in an explicit state dictionary, and prompts, prints and figures
appear only under main().

    1 constants     the wake relaxation limits
    2 imports       numpy; thick_panel_wing, vent_mesh, vent_cavity, vent_loads
    3 composition   blocks, wake influence, and the masked solve
    4 the wetted    the image-only solve, which replaces tpw.solve
    5 the cavity    the dynamic condition, and the fixed point on the length
    6 relaxation    the wake, which this module must own
    7 diagnostics   antisymmetry, and the washout margin

The image and the cavity live in one module because they are two masks over one
linear system and they INTERACT: the cavity mask has to be mirror-symmetric, or
the antisymmetry that makes the free surface exact is broken by the cavity.

Five decisions are worth stating before the code.

**The vendored `solve_once` cannot be used, and its own docstring says so** - "the
cavity driver reuses it for its wetted baseline and composes `assemble_system`
directly thereafter". It recomputes the source strengths from `-n.u_rel`, which
is exactly what the image has to override. Section 3 is the twenty-five lines
that replaces it.

**On a doubled mesh, the vendored solve IS the rigid-wall answer.** For an onset
with no spanwise component, mirroring leaves `-n.u_rel` unchanged, so the
unflipped source strengths are the positive image: `tpw.solve` on a ventilating
state returns the zero-Froude, rigid-wall solution, silently and plausibly, with
about twice the lift and its peak loading at the waterline instead of zero there.
That is measured, not feared - `test_vent` asserts the bit-for-bit agreement
between the positive image and `tpw.solve`, so the hazard is on the record.

**This module owns the wake relaxation, and must.** The vendored `solve`'s
docstring warns that a driver composing its own system must; here there is a
second reason, which is that the image wake has to be projected after every
convection rather than advected. See `vent_mesh.symmetrise_wake`.

**The cavity iteration is cold-started from the committed length every call.** A
warm start from the previous coupling subiteration would make the converged cavity
depend on the iteration path at the level of the cavity tolerance, and the outer
quasi-Newton accelerator differentiates that noise. The cost is a few extra
iterations and it buys the property the whole partitioned scheme rests on: the
load is a deterministic function of the displacement and the committed regime.

**The cavity condition enters the system on panels more than half covered, while
the pressure blends continuously.** The system mask has to be binary, so
something must switch discretely somewhere. It is placed at the panel midpoint
because at the converged length the cavity pressure equals the wetted pressure at
the closure point - that is what determines the length - so the prescribed and
the solved doublet strength agree there to first order and the switch is smooth.
The load's continuity in the cavity length is then measured, not assumed.
