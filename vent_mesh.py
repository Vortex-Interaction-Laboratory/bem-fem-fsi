"""The surface-piercing strut: its doubled mesh, and the mirror maps.

A surface-piercing strut has an open section at the waterline, and the vendored
solver cannot represent one: `validate_mesh` requires both span-end stations to
be collapsed onto the camber line, and `update_points` re-pins them
unconditionally on every call. The free surface therefore enters as an exact
NEGATIVE IMAGE realised by mesh doubling - the immersed strut plus its mirror as
one legal closed thick-wrap-1 body, with the free surface at mid-span and a
FULL-CHORD section there, which is where the cavity is longest and where a
single pinched foil of span h would have had no chord at all.

Seven dependency-ordered sections, and the same three discipline rules: nothing
imports downward, every block is a pure function over explicit arguments with all
mutable data in an explicit state dictionary, and prompts, prints and figures
appear only under main().

    1 constants     the depth axis, and the mirror reflection
    2 imports       numpy; thick_panel_wing, make_thick_sample_inputs, fem_mesh
    3 the strut     strut_mesh, and the symmetrisation that makes it exact
    4 mirror maps   the index algebra, built once
    5 half and full the two directions, for points and for vectors
    6 the wake      the projection that keeps the image an image
    7 the structure the immersed solid, clamped at the waterline

This is a builders-only module, like fem_mesh: nothing in the solve path imports
it, and the maps it builds travel in the `vent` state as integer arrays, so
`vent_solve` needs no import of it.

Four decisions are worth stating before the code.

**The immersed half is authoritative, always.** The image is a mathematical
device, not a piece of fluid: everything about it is computed from the real half,
never solved for and never convected. `symmetrise_points` and `symmetrise_wake`
both write the image from the real half and never the other way.

**The symmetry is enforced, not inherited.** `thick_wing_mesh` with unit taper
and no sweep or twist IS the doubled strut, and the yaw rotation is about the
span axis and does not touch it, so almost everything is symmetric already. But
`np.linspace(-a, a, n+1)` is bit-exactly antisymmetric only when n is a power of
two - it is not at n = 12, 20 or 24 - so the last bits of the spanwise
coordinate must be overwritten from the real half. For a prismatic strut that
overwrite changes nothing but those bits, and it makes the property hold for any
station count and any spanwise spacing rather than for a lucky few.

**The waterline station is NOT a pinched tip, and `fem_mesh` had to be told.**
On the immersed half the far station is the open root at the waterline. The
vendored-style rib rebuild replaces the half-thickness at both ends with the
neighbour's, which for an untapered strut is bit-exact and therefore a latent
trap rather than a live bug; `foil_ribs` now takes which ends to rebuild.

**The wake cannot be mirrored by convecting it.** With phi antisymmetric the
perturbation velocity obeys v'(Rx) = -R v'(x) while the onset obeys v(Rx) =
+R v(x), so mirror-consistent advection would need v' = 0. Left to `convect`,
the image wake drifts off the mirror position and the free-surface condition is
lost silently and progressively over a march. Section 6 projects it instead, and
the drift it discards is a physically meaningful diagnostic - see the docstring
of `symmetrise_wake`.

    both tips pinched, spanning y in [y_fs - h, y_fs]. There is then no free
    surface at all: the waterline behaves as a second tip, which forces the
    loading to zero there as the image does, but the chord vanishes there too.
    It is a cheap fixture and a fallback, not a model of a free surface.

    The strut is prismatic - unit taper, no sweep, no twist - and yawed by
    alpha_deg about the span axis, which for a vertical span is the incidence.
    Composed from the vendored builder and then symmetrised; no geometry is
    written here beyond the station depths.

    spacing chooses the depth of the spanwise stations on the immersed half:
    'uniform' (the default); 'tip', the builder's cosine over the whole doubled
    span, which clusters at the pinched tip and is coarsest at the waterline;
    'cosine', a full cosine over the immersed half, clustered at both the tip
    and the waterline, the two places where the loading varies fastest. The
    strut is prismatic, so moving a station changes nothing but its depth.

    tip_taper > 0 thins the section linearly to zero over that length (same
    units as h and chord) above the free tip, so the tip is a wedge of fixed
    angle: with tip shedding and tip_taper = 0.1 chord the strut's C_L stays
    within 0.6 % from 12 to 64 strips (AR_h 1, alpha 10 deg, wetted). The
